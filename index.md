# About Me
Hey there!
My name is Karsh.

 I am a mechanical engineer pursuing Masters in Robotic Systems Development at the Carnegie Mellon University.

This website is dedicated to the projects that I have done so far as an engineering student, and the work I am currently doing. I'm a robotics enthusiast and strongly feel that every engineer must know how to code. Take a look at the projects page and see if any project catches your interest.

If you have anything to share, contact me via email. My email address is

Cheers!
